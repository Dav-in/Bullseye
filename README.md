# Bullseye

Game Description:

    User attempts to place the slider in position to match the game's randomly generated target number. 
    Points are given based on the distance of the user's guess from the target number 
    EX:
    
      Target : 55
      User's Guess : 58
      
      *Max possible points = 100
      
      Target - Guess * -1 = 3
      User's points = 100 - 3 = 97 
      Total points = 97
